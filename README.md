## FotoFinder

#### Author:
Kim Myers


#### Built with:
* HTML
* CSS 
* Classic Javascript

This project relied heavily on JavaScript. I was able to create the UI with HTML and CSS and it is responsive on large and small screens.

---

#### Project requirements:
Build an app to post photos that can be stored, deleted, rated and searched. The user had the ability to edit title and caption text of the original post and favor a photo or delete it.

#### Goals:
Provide a fluid and responsive client-side interface which relies on JavaScript, specifically localStorage, to persist photos between sessions.

* Build a responsive client-side application.
* Implement client-side data persistence using localStorage.
* Iterate over dom elements in order to filter what is being displayed by filtering the text in posts or filtering by favorites.
* Give user ability to delete posts from DOM and local storage.
* Craft code with clean style, using small functions that show trends toward DRYness.

#### Challenges:
The new challenge was posting images to the dom and saving those in localStorage.
---


#### Wins:
I tried some different strategies for event delegation. While some paths I went down didn't turn out to produce what I wanted,  I was still able to learn about other methods of triggering events on the DOM.
